     * A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
     * <p>
     * For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr:
     * [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
     * <p>
     * The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer.
     * More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order,
     * then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container.
     * If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
     * <p>
     * For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
     * <p>
     * Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
